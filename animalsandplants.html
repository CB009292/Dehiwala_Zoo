                    <h3>Peacock</h3>
                    <p>Peacocks, sometimes known as peafowl, are medium-sized birds with pheasant-like characteristics. Peacocks are found in the Southern Hemisphere's warm regions. Peacocks are said to have originated in Asia, although they currently live in portions of Africa and Australia. In India, they are the most prevalent. Deserts, arid savannas, woods, and rich vegetation environments are all home to peacocks. The Indian peacock, the African Congo peacock, and the Green peacock are the three primary varieties of peacock. Male peacocks are famed for their beautifully colored feathers and stories in all three peacock species. Female peacocks have a drab brown coloration.

                    <h3>Elephant</h3>
                    <p>Elephants are the world's biggest land animals, with gigantic bodies, large ears, and lengthy trunks. They utilize their trunks for a variety of tasks, including picking up things, trumpeting warnings, greeting other elephants, and sucking up water for drinking or bathing. Male and female African elephants both have tusks, which can be either left or right, and the one they use the most is typically smaller due to wear and tear. Elephant tusks have a variety of uses. Elephants may utilize their expanded teeth to defend their trunks, lift and move items, harvest food, and remove bark from trees. They can also be employed as a defensive mechanism. Elephants also use their tusks to dig holes to get water underground during droughts.</p>

                    <h3>Lionfish</h3>
                    <p>The poisonous fin spines of lionfish are capable of inflicting severe, though rarely deadly, puncture wounds. The fish have longer dorsal fin spines and expanded pectoral fins, and each species has a distinct pattern of vivid, zebra like stripes. When disturbed, the fish spread and expose their fins before presenting and attacking with their dorsal spines if forced further.</p>

                    <h3>Tiger</h3>
                    <p>The tiger is the biggest member of the cat family (Felidae) and is only surpassed in power and ferocity by the lion. The tiger is endangered across its range, which runs from the Russian Far East to the Indonesian island of Sumatra via North Korea, China, India, and Southeast Asia. Tigers (particularly males) are solitary creatures who develop and maintain their own territories, which vary in size and type depending on the amount and distribution of prey, the presence of other tigers in the region, the topography, water availability, and individual features.</p>

                    <h3>Black Mamba</h3>
                    <p>Black mambas are swift, anxious, poisonous, and very aggressive when threatened. They've been blamed for a slew of human fatalities, and African legends magnify their talents to mythical dimensions. The black mamba is commonly regarded as the world's deadliest snake for these reasons. The savannas and rocky slopes of southern and eastern Africa are home to black mambas. They are Africa's longest poisonous snake, reaching lengths of up to 14 feet, however the average length is 8.2 feet. They're also among the world's fastest snakes, capable of crawling at speeds of up to 12.5 mph.</p>

                    <h3>Zebra</h3>
                    <p>Zebras are herd animals who spend time together. They groom one another and graze together, usually on grass. The most frequent zebra species is the plains zebra. They reside in tiny family groupings that include a stallion, several females, and their offspring. These units may band together to form massive herds with tens of thousands of heads, yet family members will remain close within the herd. Lions and hyenas must always be on the lookout for zebras. Many eyes in a herd are vigilant to danger. When an animal is assaulted, its family will defend it by surrounding the injured zebra and attempting to push predators away.</p>

Insects drawn to the plant by the attractive, vibrant colors are looking for nectar. Any hungry insect, on the other hand, is in for a rude awakening when it realizes it can't get out of the Pitcher Plant's pitcher. This is due to the waxy scales that coat the inside walls of the leaves, making them extremely slippery. Insects that perch on the pitcher are highly likely to slide and fall to the bottom of the pitcher, where they will be bathed in the digestive juices secreted by the plants before they can react.</td>
